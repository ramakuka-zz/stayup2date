# StayUp2Date
## Say what?
Stayup2date is a project that wants to help you stay up to date with the latest news on the things that matter to you.
## Why?
After years of trying to keep up, get to the right content, follow the right influencers on Twitter,Linkedin,Medium,Facebook read through hacker news,TechCrunch,read it and what not - just to find out that it's not working for me! I decided to try to build it!
## How?
Community! or more like communities, micro communities that can be focused on a single topic. The community members will share their best sources, influencers, secret blogger so the StayUp2Date can scan them, collect the data, rate it and display it (or send it) to all other members as a nice portal-like page.
